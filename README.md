# What is this Project
This a Personal Project Where I am using https://openweathermap.org/ API to Extract Weather data based on the City and State you live in and display it on screen.

## To Run this code Follow the Following steps.

1) Downlaod the files and open the html with your browser (I prefer using Live Server Extension in VSCODE).
2) Once it is up on your server, you will go to https://openweathermap.org/ and create an account and retrieve your API KEY
3) Once you have the Key you will want to past it on Line 2 of the main.js file (const apiKey = "INSERT KEY HERE";
4) Once that is complete you will be able to enter a city and a State. Abbreviation or full name of state work.
